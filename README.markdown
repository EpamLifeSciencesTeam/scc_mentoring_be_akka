A [Giter8][g8] template for EPAM Scala Competency Center Akka Http + Slick web application!

# How to use this project

First of all, you'll need [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org). Follow its [installation instructions](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) and make sure `sbt console` opens Scala REPL.

Next, you'll need to run `sbt new EpamLifeSciencesTeam/scc_mentoring_be_akka.g8` and answer its questions about organization name (package name) and project name.

This scaffolded project will contain:
- [Akka Http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html)
- [Akka Actor](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/index.html)
- [Akka Stream](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html)
- [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/)
- [pureconfig](https://pureconfig.github.io)
- [slick](https://scala-slick.org)

To run this project first run docker-compose to start PostgreSql with configured settings.

Then execute `sbt build run` to start server on the default 8080 port â€” or edit `application.conf` and provide your desired port number instead.
